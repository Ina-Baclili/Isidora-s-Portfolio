    <p>I started out as a traditional artist evolving from pencil/sketching to paint and canvas and other materials, such as paper sculptures. During my secondary education, I learned about photo editing and social media management as a part of our productions' publicity team. As an arts and design high school graduate, I have basic skills in film, photo manipulation, stage design, and social media work. Although, I slimmed down my focus and <a href="#specialization">specialized</a> in specific fields to further develop my skills in them. Later on, I ventured into digital design, Illustrator and Photoshop. I like to practice both traditional and digital, interchanging the skills I've developed from both!</p>
